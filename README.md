# Analytical-Plots
Here, you'll find MATLAB and Python scripts for plotting data using .csv files. There are scripts particularly useful to plot IR, excitation/emission spectra and rheology plots.  Define location and path of .csv files in filename and run the code. Multiple .csv files can be plotted in a single plot. Useful to create comparative plots.
